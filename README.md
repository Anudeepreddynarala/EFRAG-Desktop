### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Form Filling
**NEW!** Let AI help fill out your sustainability form automatically:
- Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, TXT, JSON)
- ChatGPT extracts data from your sustainability reports
- Zero hallucination policy - AI never guesses or infers data
- Every extracted value includes source citation and confidence score
- Clear transparency reports showing what was found vs. not found
- Review and approve each field before applying to form

**How it Works:**
1. Configure your OpenAI API key (one-time setup)
2. Upload sustainability reports or financial documents
3. Optionally add instructions (e.g., "Focus on Q1 2024 data")
4. AI analyzes documents and extracts form data
5. Review results with confidence scores and source citations
6. Accept, edit, or reject each field
7. Apply approved data to your form

**Powered by ChatGPT:**
- Uses GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, or GPT-3.5 models
- Supports complex multi-document analysis
- Estimates cost before processing (~$0.05-$0.50 per form)
