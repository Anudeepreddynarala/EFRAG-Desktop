# EFRAG Desktop

A desktop application for sustainability reporting following EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group) standards.

## What is EFRAG Desktop?

EFRAG Desktop helps companies create sustainability reports that meet European reporting standards. It's a simple application that runs on your computer (Windows or Mac) without needing an internet connection.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Form Filling (Experimental)
**NEW!** Let AI help fill out your sustainability form automatically:
- Upload documents (PDF, TXT, CSV, JSON, DOCX) or paste text
- AI extracts data from your sustainability reports
- 100% local processing - your data never leaves your computer
- Zero hallucination policy - AI never guesses or infers data
- Every extracted value includes source citation and confidence score
- Clear transparency reports showing what was found vs. not found
- User-friendly setup with [Jan](https://jan.ai) - no command line needed

**Privacy & Security:**
- All AI processing runs locally on your computer
- No external API calls or internet connection required
- Suitable for sensitive business data
- Models optimized for data extraction (Qwen 2.5, Mistral, Gemma)
