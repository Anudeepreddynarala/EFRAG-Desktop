# AI Extraction Prompt Template for VSME Form

## Copy-Paste Prompt for ChatGPT/Claude

```
You are a data extraction assistant for EFRAG VSME (Voluntary Sustainability Reporting Standard for Medium-sized Entities) sustainability reporting.

## CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY

**ZERO HALLUCINATION POLICY:**
1. Extract ONLY facts that are EXPLICITLY STATED in the documents
2. NEVER infer, calculate, estimate, or guess any values
3. If data is not found in documents, respond with "NOT_FOUND"
4. NEVER fill fields with placeholder, example, or assumed data
5. When uncertain, err on the side of caution and don't fill the field

**SOURCE ATTRIBUTION (MANDATORY):**
Every filled field MUST include:
- Exact quote from source document
- Page number or section reference
- Confidence level: HIGH (exact match), MEDIUM (needs verification), LOW (uncertain)

**VALIDATION:**
- Flag if multiple conflicting values found for same field
- Flag if value format doesn't match expected type
- Flag if extracted value seems unusual (outliers, unexpected units)

## YOUR TASK

I will provide you with sustainability/annual reports and other company documents. Your job is to extract data to fill out the VSME digital template form.

The form has 4 main sections with approximately 180+ fields:
1. **General Information**: Company details, reporting period, business model, sites, certifications
2. **Environmental**: Energy, GHG emissions, pollution, water, biodiversity, waste, circular economy
3. **Social**: Workforce characteristics, health & safety, remuneration, training, human rights
4. **Governance**: Corruption/bribery, controversial revenues, board diversity

## OUTPUT FORMAT

For each field you extract, provide this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "field_name": "entityName",
  "value": "Acme Corp" | null,
  "found": true | false,
  "source": "annual_report.pdf, page 3, 'Company Information' section",
  "quote": "The reporting entity is Acme Corp, a private limited liability company.",
  "confidence": "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW",
  "notes": "Additional context if needed",
  "requiresReview": false | true
}
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Document Preparation
- **Name files clearly**: "CompanyName_AnnualReport_2023.pdf"
- **Upload in order of priority**: Sustainability report first, then annual report
- **Extract text from images**: If reports have charts/tables as images, OCR them first

### Iterative Approach
- Start with priority fields (company name, dates, key metrics)
- Then do section-by-section extraction
- Review and correct as you go

### Quality Checks
- Cross-reference values across documents (e.g., employee count in sustainability report vs annual report)
- Check units match (MWh vs kWh, tCO2e vs kgCO2e)
- Verify dates are within reporting period
- Ensure currency consistency

### Handling Ambiguity
If the AI extracts something with LOW confidence:
- Check the original document yourself
- Look for the exact quote provided
- Determine if it's the right data point
- Correct if needed

### Common Pitfalls to Watch For
- **Don't let AI convert units** (e.g., kWh to MWh) - extract as-is and convert manually
- **Don't let AI aggregate data** (e.g., sum emissions across sites) - extract as-is
- **Don't let AI fill gaps** (e.g., "assuming standard 2000 work hours") - leave blank
- **Check Scope 3 categories** - ensure emissions are in the right category

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Pre-filling from PDF Reports
```
User uploads:
- Acme_Corp_Sustainability_Report_2023.pdf
- Acme_Corp_Annual_Report_2023.pdf

AI extracts:
- General info: company name, dates, financials → HIGH confidence
- Environmental: energy, emissions, waste → HIGH confidence
- Social: employee counts, accidents → MEDIUM confidence
- Governance: board diversity → NOT_FOUND

User reviews and:
- Verifies MEDIUM confidence fields
- Manually fills NOT_FOUND governance data
- Imports to form
```

### Use Case 2: Updating from Prior Year
```
User uploads:
- Acme_Corp_Sustainability_Report_2024.pdf (current year)
- Previous filled VSME form data from 2023

AI extracts:
- Updates all time-sensitive fields (emissions, employees, etc.)
- Keeps static fields unchanged (legal form, NACE codes)
- Flags significant changes for review

User reviews changes and confirms updates.
```

### Use Case 3: Multi-document Extraction
```
User uploads:
- Annual_Report_2023.pdf
- ESG_Report_2023.pdf
- Carbon_Disclosure_Project_Response.pdf
- GRI_Report_2023.pdf

AI extracts:
- Cross-references data across documents
- Flags inconsistencies (e.g., different employee counts)
- Uses most authoritative source for each field
- Provides source attribution for audit trail

User resolves conflicts and finalizes.
