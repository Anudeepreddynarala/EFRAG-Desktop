After analysis, you'll see:

**‚úÖ Successfully Extracted Fields**
```
Company Name: "Acme Corporation"
Source: annual_report.pdf, page 3
Confidence: 95%
Quote: "Acme Corporation is a leading..."

- Board diversity (Confidence: 65% - multiple references found)
- Renewable energy % (Confidence: 55% - unclear unit)

### Accept or Edit Values

1. Review each extracted value
2. Check the source quote
3. Options:
   - **Accept**: Value is correct, add to form
   - **Edit**: Modify before adding
   - **Reject**: Don't use this value
4. Values marked "Needs Review" should be carefully verified

### Missing Data

For fields not found:
- You'll need to enter them manually
- The AI will list all missing fields
- Consider uploading additional documents

---

## üí° Best Practices

### Document Preparation

**For Best Results:**
- Use clear, well-formatted documents
- Include sustainability/annual reports
- PDFs with text (not just scanned images)
- Multiple years of data increase accuracy

**Supported Content:**
- Structured tables and data
- Plain text descriptions
- Financial statements
- ESG/Sustainability sections

**Less Reliable:**
- Scanned images (OCR not yet supported)
- Heavily formatted documents
- Charts and graphs (no image analysis yet)
- Handwritten notes

### Multiple Documents

Upload different types for comprehensive extraction:
1. Annual Report - General company info
2. Sustainability Report - Environmental & social data
3. Financial Statements - Revenue, assets, employees
4. Board Reports - Governance data

### Iterative Approach

1. Start with primary documents
2. Review what was found
3. Upload additional docs for missing fields
4. Repeat until satisfied

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Jan Won't Connect

**Check:**
1. Is Jan running? (should see icon in system tray)
2. Is API server enabled? (Settings > Advanced > API Server)
3. Is the port 1337? (or whatever Jan is configured to)
4. Try restarting Jan

**Fix:**
- Open Jan
- Go to Settings > Advanced
- Toggle "API Server" off and on
- Check port shows 1337
- Should say "Running"

### Model Download Failed

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Check available disk space (need 2-10GB)
3. Try a smaller model if out of space
4. Restart Jan and try again

### Low Extraction Accuracy

**Improve Results:**
1. Use better quality documents
2. Upload additional source documents
3. Try a larger AI model (if RAM allows)
4. Ensure documents contain the actual data (not just charts)

### Out of Memory

**If Jan crashes or system freezes:**
1. Close other applications
2. Choose a smaller AI model
3. Process documents one at a time
4. Restart computer and try again
5. Consider upgrading RAM for better experience

### Slow Performance

**Speed up:**
1. Close unnecessary applications
2. Use smaller AI model
3. Process shorter documents
4. Ensure SSD (not HDD) storage
5. Disable other background AI/ML apps
